/*
 * Let's say a land is represented by '1' and water is represented by '0'.
 * You are given a matrix of 1's and 0's. You need to find the size of the largest island.
 * Assume that islands are identified by top, bottom, left, right operations, not
 * including the diagonals.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * Input:  1 1 0 0 1
 *         0 0 0 0 0
 *
 * Output: 2
