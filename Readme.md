CodeBase
=============
This is my not so futile ;) effort to document and save, almost every piece of small to big code, that I encounter in my present coding life (If there are flashes from previous ones, they may find a place here too!!) 

From simple code fragments, to solutions of Problems and Interview Oriented Programming tasks, this is where it all goes in . . 

The Ultimate Code Sink . . right Here!!
